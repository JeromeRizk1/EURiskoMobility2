Second code challenge

At the login screen, we get a nice elegant background with the blue linear gradient to
nicely represent the theme of this app. Being as it is, a simple articles app,
i went with simplicity in the styling with a nice username and password text
inputs with error checks, credential checks and loading indicators when needed
throughout the app. After login, we are navigated to the dashboard screen with
the articles neatly placed, some descriptive data with a title and the article
itself with a hyperlink at the bottom. We have a search input field where
we can search for specific document types by typing in the search box, and
a clear icon to the right to go back to our initial page. Also, a pull to 
refresh function is added which resets our page view to the initial page again. 
Finally, every time we reach the end of the list a new page is loaded, taking 
us through all the articles we want to browse. Not to forget the logout icon at
the top left of course.
